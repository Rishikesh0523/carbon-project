## 🌍 Overview

The **Carbon Credits Program** is a revolutionary Web3 application built on the Solana blockchain that rewards users with actual cryptocurrency tokens for taking environmental actions. Users join the program, submit verified environmental activities (tree planting, waste collection, clean energy usage), and earn SPL tokens that have real monetary value.

### 🎯 Mission
Combating climate change through blockchain incentives by creating a transparent, verifiable, and rewarding ecosystem for environmental stewardship.
